# A Quick Introduction to MUMPS
## What is MUMPS?
MUMPS is a text processing language with an integrated database. The database
is integrated in the sense that you access the database directly from the
language itself. There is no intermediate driver to get to the database.

The acronym stands for Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming
System. The language was designed by Neil Pappalardo in 1966; and it was 
purposely designed to replace assembly language for medical use. Neil 
Pappalordo went on to start Meditech, one of the large Electronic Medical 
Records software to this day.
